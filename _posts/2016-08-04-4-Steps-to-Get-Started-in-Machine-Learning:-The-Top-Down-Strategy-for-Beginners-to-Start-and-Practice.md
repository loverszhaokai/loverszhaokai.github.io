## 1. Reference:

[4-Steps to Get Started in Machine Learning: The Top-Down Strategy for Beginners to Start and Practice](http://machinelearningmastery.com/4-steps-to-get-started-in-machine-learning/)

## 2. Conclusion: Using before theory

This article shows that learn machine learning from Top-Down.    
**Firstly**, learn how to use it.    
**Finally**, learn the deeply about the algorithm.
I think it's a good and fast way for beginners.

## 3. Top-Down approach

 1. Learn the high-level process of applied machine learning.
 2. Learn how to use a tool enough to be able to work through problems.
 3. Practice on datasets, a lot.
 4. Transition into the details and theory of machine learning algorithms.
