## 1. Reference:

[4-Steps to Get Started in Machine Learning: The Top-Down Strategy for Beginners to Start and Practice](http://machinelearningmastery.com/4-steps-to-get-started-in-machine-learning/)

## 2. Conclusion: Using before theory

This article shows that learn machine learning from Top-Down.    
**Firstly**, learn how to use it.    
**Finally**, learn the deeply about the algorithm.
I think it's a good and fast way for beginners.

## 3. Top-Down approach

 1. Learn the high-level process of applied machine learning.
 2. Learn how to use a tool enough to be able to work through problems.
 3. Practice on datasets, a lot.
 4. Transition into the details and theory of machine learning algorithms.

## 4. Applied Machine Learning Process

* Problem Definition    
* Analyze Data    
* Prepare Data    
* Evaluate Algorithms    
* Improve Results    
* Present Results    

## 5. Use the Weka Machine Learning Workbench

* [How to design and run your first experiment](http://machinelearningmastery.com/design-and-run-your-first-experiment-in-weka/)
* [How to tune an algorithm rigorously in a designed experiment](http://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-tune-a-machine-learning-algorithm-in-weka/)
* [How to use ensemble methods in Weka](http://machinelearningmastery.com/improve-machine-learning-results-with-boosting-bagging-and-blending-ensemble-methods-in-weka/)

## 6. Practice, Practice, Practice, on Datasets

## 7. Transitioning Deeper
