keywords: confidence, enthusiasm, education, past work experience, 

I am 27 years old now, and I was born in Hebei province, China.
I was graduated from HuaQiao university in 2012, majored in software engineering.
After that, I went to Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications for advanced
study in computer science and technology.
I did an intern in siemens China from 2012-2014. The project is about a fuzz testing
system to find vulnerabilities of the equipments. My main duty is to implement new 
features and debug, using cpp under Fedora 18.

I took part in Google Summer of Code from April to August 2015, the project is to
improve the robustness of John the ripper. I did fuzz testing for this project, and
finally, there were more than 100 bugs found. And some bugs were fixed by me. What's
mnore, I implmented two new features and improved the fuzz testing speed by 10 times.

That's all.

## 3. What are your weaknesses ?

Perfectionist

Here is one weakness, since I love the computer science, so I usually want to know why ?
Why the size of the executable files have great different when you have many static variables which
are initialized by zero or nonzeroes ?

Why the cpp can support polymorphism ?

I always try to accomplish everything, and I just want everything to be perfect but then
I realized that I am losing out at the same time. So maybe that makes some projects pretty late.

Well five years from now, I want to be an expert in some areas of computer science.
Such as linux programming environment, or linux kernel, or software architecture.

## 5. What do you know about our company ?

I would weigh on the pros and cons, and also I would take some adive from my team members.
I am sure that would help me to come on the decision.
