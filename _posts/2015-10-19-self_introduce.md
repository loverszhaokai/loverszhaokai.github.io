Good afternoon,
This is Kai Zhao.
It is really my hornor to have this opportunity for an interview.

I am 27 years old, born in Hebei province, China.

I was graduated from HuaQiao University, majored in software engineering,
and I got my bachelor degree after graduate in 2012.
During the four years of college study, I have two years experience of using
C# with winform and ASP.NET.


I have studied in Beijing University of posts and telecommunications since 2012,
I will get the Master degree and graduate in April, 2016.
I major in computer science and technology.

I did an internship for about two years in siemens, China, which was from 2012-2014.
The project is a fuzz testing system for siemens,
my mainly duty was to implement new features and debug.
I have two years experience of using CPP under Fedora.

After the internship in siemens, I took part in Google Summer of Code
from April, 2015 to August, 2015.
This project is to improve the robustness of John the ripper.
By fuzz testing, I found more than 100 bugs.
I fixed some of these bugs.
Also, I implemented two features and improved the fuzz testing speed about 10 times.


My graduation project is also about Fuzz testing.


I want to get a job in Bloomberg, London.
Because Bloomberg is a great company, and London is a leading global city.


That's all. Thank you for giving me the chance.
