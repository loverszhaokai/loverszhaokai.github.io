## Date

From Sep 7, 2012 to April 21, 2015

## Summary

Liang Ge is my roommate for 3 years. It's weird that I wanted to kill him at
the first time but not now.

We got along from November 1, 2014 to April 21, 2015 which is about half a year.
What impressed me most is his character that he was a slowcoach. He was always
procrastinate and always did things after the deadline. Maybe due to his character,
he was good-tempered. That's why we got along well. I am a weird person and few
people can bear me. I always scolded him and he did not mind that. As such, he likes
Wengli Wen.


## Important Events

April 21, 2015

1. We went to Jinguyuan to eat dumpling which was prok and mushrooms.

2. We went to the first floor of old mess hall to get two bowls to remember BUPT.

3. We went to Beijing West Railway Station by taxi, and Liang Ge's grew moist but
not cried.

## Goodbye

May you be happy at Chengdu. And appreciate the next time we get together.
