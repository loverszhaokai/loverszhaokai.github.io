<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Liang Ge is my roommate for 3 years. It’s weird that I wanted to kill him at
the first time but not now.</p>

<p>We got along from November 1, 2014 to April 21, 2015 which is about half a year.
What impressed me most is his character that he was a slowcoach. He was always
procrastinate and always did things after the deadline. Maybe due to his character,
he was good-tempered. That’s why we got along well. I am a weird person and few
people can bear me. I always scolded him and he did not mind that. As such, he likes
Wengli Wen.</p>
