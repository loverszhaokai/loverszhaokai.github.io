<h2 id="tell-me-about-yourself-">1. Tell me about yourself ?</h2>

<p>keywords: confidence, enthusiasm, education, past work experience,</p>

<p>I am 27 years old now, and I was born in Hebei province, China.
I was graduated from HuaQiao university in 2012, majored in software engineering.
After that, I went to Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications for advanced
study in computer science and technology.
I did an intern in siemens China from 2012-2014. The project is about a fuzz testing
system to find vulnerabilities of the equipments. My main duty is to implement new 
features and debug, using cpp under Fedora 18.</p>

<p>I took part in Google Summer of Code from April to August 2015, the project is to
improve the robustness of John the ripper. I did fuzz testing for this project, and
finally, there were more than 100 bugs found. And some bugs were fixed by me. What’s
mnore, I implmented two new features and improved the fuzz testing speed by 10 times.</p>

<p>That’s all.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-strengths-">2. What are your strengths ?</h2>

<p>A. I can focus my full attention on my work, and I am very efficient.
B. I am good at making plans and I have great execution.
C. Because of my very outgoing nature, many people have said that I am quite approachable.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-weaknesses-">3. What are your weaknesses ?</h2>

<p>Perfectionist</p>

<p>Here is one weakness, since I love the computer science, so I usually want to know why ?
Why the size of the executable files have great different when you have many static variables which
are initialized by zero or nonzeroes ?</p>

<p>Why the cpp can support polymorphism ?</p>

<p>I always try to accomplish everything, and I just want everything to be perfect but then
I realized that I am losing out at the same time. So maybe that makes some projects pretty late.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-you-see-yourself-in-five-years-">4. Where do you see yourself in five years ?</h2>

<p>Well five years from now, I want to be an expert in some areas of computer science.
Such as linux programming environment, or linux kernel, or software architecture.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-know-about-our-company-">5. What do you know about our company ?</h2>

<p>A. IBM i software engineer</p>

<p>IBM i is one of important IBM operation systems which is running on an IBM Power Systems,
offering a highly scalable and virus resistant architecture. CSTL IBM i team was found in
2005 and had grown up with more than 100 people by now.</p>

<h2 id="how-well-do-you-handle-change-">6. How well do you handle change ?</h2>

<p>I think I can handle change well. Changes are everywhere, sometimes they are small and sometimes
they are big. I think I am prepared for any changes, since I am flexible and hard working.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-work-well-under-pressure-">7. Do you work well under pressure ?</h2>

<p>I think I can work well under pressure. The pressure usually comes when we must accomplish our
goal in short time. I will cooperate with my colleagues to make plans and try our best to finish
our task.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-make-important-decisions-">8. How do you make important decisions ?</h2>

<p>I would weigh on the pros and cons, and also I would take some adive from my team members.
I am sure that would help me to come on the decision.</p>

This is Kai Zhao.
It is really my hornor to have this opportunity for an interview.</p>

<p>I am 27 years old, born in Hebei province, China.</p>

and I got my bachelor degree after graduate in 2012.
During the four years of college study, I have two years experience of using
C# with winform and ASP.NET.</p>

<p>I have studied in Beijing University of posts and telecommunications since 2012,
I will get the Master degree and graduate in April, 2016.
I major in computer science and technology.</p>

<p>I did an internship for about two years in siemens, China, which was from 2012-2014.
The project is a fuzz testing system for siemens,
my mainly duty was to implement new features and debug.
I have two years experience of using CPP under Fedora.</p>

<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

<p>My proposal is: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2015/zhaokai/5629499534213120">John the Ripper jumbo robustness improvements</a></p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<p>This project aims at improving the robustness of John the Ripper jumbo,
especially faced with invalid input. There are mainly two approaches, 
one through fuzzing, and the other through source code review. By fuzzing,
American Fuzzy Lop(AFL) can be customized and integrated with John the Ripper
jumbo. By source code review, manual reviews and automated static analysis 
such as valgrind, cppcheck and ClangStatic Analyzer can be used.</p>
